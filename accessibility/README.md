# Accessibility Guidelines

This repository contains guidelines and resources for creating accessible web content and applications.

## Why Accessibility Matters

Accessibility ensures that everyone, including individuals with disabilities, can access and interact with web content. By prioritizing accessibility, we promote inclusivity and ensure equal access to information and services.

## Getting Started

To ensure accessibility in your projects, follow these guidelines:

### 1. Understand Accessibility Standards

Familiarize yourself with accessibility standards such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to understand the requirements for accessible web content.

### 2. Use Semantic HTML

Use semantic HTML elements (e.g., `<button>`, `<input>`, `<h1>`â€“`<h6>`) to provide meaning and structure to your content. This helps assistive technologies interpret and navigate your content more effectively.

### 3. Provide Alternative Text for Images

Always include descriptive alt text for images to provide context and convey information to users who cannot see them. Alt text should describe the purpose or content of the image.

```html
<img src="example.jpg" alt="A person using a white cane to cross the street">
